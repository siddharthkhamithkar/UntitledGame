    <body bgcolour="white"><h1> Hi! This is my test document for CSS. I will be testing whatever I learn in school in here. So get ready for really stupid things.</h1>
      <p> Okay. If you are really going to hang out on this document for a few more minutes, I should start by introducing myself. My name is Siddharth and I study in the 9th grade as of 2017. You can be sure that if we meet up in real life some day, I would bore you to hell. You will probably get fed up by me within seconds but I really doubt that I would be so annoying if we both share the same interests. This will be a series of me wrecking up my keyboard becasuse I am typing faster than I could ever imagine. You should know this that I am the fastest typer in my class with the speed of 64 words per second. But I doubt that I would ever be faster than my brother in typing, after all he's the one who got me into typing fast. So I guess this is it for now. I will keep updating this as I <u>get the time for it.</u> Peace. </p>
      <p class="big">There is a list below naming my favorite games.</p>
      <ol type="I"><li>RuneScape!
      </ol>At first comes RuneScape because it has been one of the games I have stuck to for the longest time, since 2013. I met most of my online gaming buddies in RS and my clan, Shadow Imperium is like heaven.
      <ol type="I" start"2"><li>Half-Life 2!
      </ol> Second place goes to Half-Life 2 because it has been the only game with a favourable story line. I really love the game but I have not gotten a proper chance to complete the game yet. The story line is just amazing.
      <ol type="I" start="3"><li>Heroes & Generals!
      </ol> Heroes & Generals is the only MMOFPS(Massively Multiplayer Online First Person Shooter) game which I had the longest interest for. Sadly since my laptop got wrecked I don't have a chance to play it anymore. This is the game which got me into World War 2 history. My WWII knowledge would be nothing without this game.
      <p class="big"> Well that's my list of favorite games. Only 3, I know!</p> <br>
      <p class="big">There is another list below naming my favorite movies.</p>
      <ol type="I"><li>Dunkirk(2017)!
      </ol> First place goes to Dunkirk(2017) because of the screenplay and the storywriting. There were a few flaws which were being the number of aircrafts used, but if you would ignore these flaws creted due to the budget it's an overall great movie! a must watch!
      <ol type="I" start="2"><li>Inglorious Bastards!
      </ol> Inglorious Basterds was my favorite movie before Dunkirk released. I really loved the way they put things together in the movie, 2 different groups of people trying to assasinate the same person. Put the pieces in it's place and you will get the storyline.
      <ol type="I" start="3"><li>The Desert Fox!
      </ol> Ah! Nothing like a movie about the Hitler's favorite general, Erwin Rommel. In this movie, a British soldier who was held captive by the DAK(Deutsches Afrika Korps) started admiring Rommel and wrote a book on him. Rommel was really a great general, cared for his troops instead of the objective sometimes, and on the other times scrambled transport vehicles to gather fuel. A general with the heart made of iron I say!<br>
